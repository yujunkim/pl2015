(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (optimize_0plus_b)  *)
(** Since the [optimize_0plus] tranformation doesn't change the value
    of [aexp]s, we should be able to apply it to all the [aexp]s that
    appear in a [bexp] without changing the [bexp]'s value.  Write a
    function which performs that transformation on [bexp]s, and prove
    it is sound.  Use the tacticals we've just seen to make the proof
    as elegant as possible. *)

Fixpoint optimize_0plus_b (b : bexp) : bexp :=
  match b with
  | BTrue       => BTrue
  | BFalse      => BFalse
  | BEq a1 a2   => BEq (optimize_0plus a1) (optimize_0plus a2)
  | BLe a1 a2   => BLe (optimize_0plus a1) (optimize_0plus a2)
  | BNot b1     => BNot (optimize_0plus_b b1)
  | BAnd b1 b2  => BAnd (optimize_0plus_b b1) (optimize_0plus_b b2)

Theorem optimize_0plus_sound': forall a,

Proof.
  intros a.
  induction a;
    (* Most cases follow directly by the IH *)
    try (simpl; rewrite IHa1; rewrite IHa2; reflexivity).
  (* The remaining cases -- ANum and APlus -- are different *)
  Case "ANum". reflexivity.
  Case "APlus".

      (* Again, most cases follow directly by the IH *)
      try (simpl; simpl in IHa1; rewrite IHa1;
           rewrite IHa2; reflexivity).
    (* The interesting case, on which the [try...] does nothing,
       is when [e1 = ANum n]. In this case, we have to destruct
       [n] (to see whether the optimization applies) and rewrite
       with the induction hypothesis. *)
